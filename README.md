## sort_vizualiser

The `sort_vizualiser` folder contains the source code and documentation for a sorting algorithm visualization tool. This tool allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action, helping them understand how these algorithms work and how they affect the order of elements in a collection.

It has been done for learning purpose only (JS Promise and sorting algorithms)

### Features

- Interactive visualization of sorting algorithms
- Support for various sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and more
- Customizable array size and speed of visualization
- Step-by-step visualization with detailed explanations
- User-friendly interface

### Usage

To use the `sort_vizualiser` tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `sort_vizualiser` folder in your preferred code editor.
3. Start the application by opening the `index.html` file in your web browser.
4. Select a sorting algorithm from the dropdown menu.
5. Adjust the array size and visualization speed as desired.
6. Click the "Start" button to begin the visualization.
7. Observe the sorting algorithm in action and the changes it makes to the array.
8. Once the sorting is complete, you can reset the array or choose a different sorting algorithm.
